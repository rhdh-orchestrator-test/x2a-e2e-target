# MIGRATION FROM CHEF/ANSIBLE TO ANSIBLE

## Executive Summary

This repository contains a mix of Chef InSpec compliance tests and Ansible playbooks that are used together to demonstrate compliance automation. The primary focus appears to be showing how Chef InSpec can be used alongside Ansible for compliance testing. The repository also contains Chef Automate and Chef Infra Server deployment scripts. The migration scope is relatively small, with only a few Ansible playbooks and InSpec tests to migrate. The estimated timeline for migration is 1-2 weeks, with low complexity.

## Module Migration Plan

This repository contains Chef InSpec tests and Ansible playbooks that need individual migration planning:

### MODULE INVENTORY

- **website_https**:
    - Description: Ansible playbook that sets up an Apache web server with HTTPS support using self-signed certificates
    - Path: chef-and-ansible/website_https.yml
    - Technology: Ansible
    - Key Features: Apache2 installation, SSL certificate generation, virtual host configuration

- **poodle_fix**:
    - Description: Ansible playbook that fixes SSL configuration in Apache to mitigate POODLE vulnerability
    - Path: chef-and-ansible/poodle_fix.yml
    - Technology: Ansible
    - Key Features: Disables vulnerable SSL protocols, enables TLSv1.2

- **website_https_verify**:
    - Description: Chef InSpec test that verifies HTTPS website functionality and security
    - Path: chef-and-ansible/tests/website_https_verify.rb
    - Technology: Chef InSpec
    - Key Features: Port listening check, HTTPS response verification, SSL protocol security verification

- **ssh_profile**:
    - Description: Chef InSpec control that ensures SSH root login is disabled for security compliance
    - Path: chef-and-ansible/tests/ssh_profile.rb
    - Technology: Chef InSpec
    - Key Features: SSH configuration verification, compliance with security standards (SRG-OS-000112)

- **chef-automate-deployment**:
    - Description: Bash script for deploying Chef Automate and Chef Infra Server
    - Path: setup-automate/deploy-automate.sh
    - Technology: Bash/Chef
    - Key Features: Chef Automate installation, Chef Infra Server setup, user and organization creation

- **chef-server-deployment**:
    - Description: Bash script for deploying Chef Infra Server without Automate
    - Path: setup-automate/deploy-chef-server.sh
    - Technology: Bash/Chef
    - Key Features: Chef Infra Server installation, user and organization creation

### Infrastructure Files

- `kitchen.yml`: Test Kitchen configuration for running Ansible playbooks and InSpec tests. Migration consideration: Replace with Ansible-native testing framework like Molecule.
- `index.html`: Simple HTML file used for testing web server deployment. Migration consideration: Keep as-is or update as needed.

### Target Details

Based on the source configuration files:

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04 (explicitly specified in kitchen.yml)
- **Virtual Machine Technology**: Vagrant (specified in kitchen.yml driver)
- **Cloud Platform**: Not specified, appears to be on-premises or generic cloud VM deployment

## Migration Approach

### Key Dependencies to Address

- **Chef InSpec**: Replace with Ansible-native testing solutions:
  - Option 1: Use Ansible's assert module for basic compliance checks
  - Option 2: Integrate with Ansible Lint for static analysis
  - Option 3: Use Molecule for comprehensive testing
  - Option 4: Consider maintaining InSpec as a separate testing tool that can be called from Ansible

- **Test Kitchen**: Replace with Molecule for Ansible playbook testing

### Security Considerations

- **SSL Configuration**: The migration must maintain the security hardening in the poodle_fix.yml playbook
  - Ensure TLSv1.2 is enforced and older protocols are disabled
  - Maintain proper certificate generation and configuration

- **SSH Security**: Maintain the SSH root login restrictions as verified by the InSpec test
  - Implement equivalent checks in Ansible

- **Vault/secrets management**:
  - Hardcoded credentials in setup scripts (username, password) should be moved to Ansible Vault
  - SSL certificates should be managed securely

### Technical Challenges

- **InSpec to Ansible Testing**: Converting InSpec tests to Ansible-native testing will require careful mapping of test assertions
  - Mitigation: Create a mapping document for InSpec resources to Ansible modules
  - Consider using Ansible's assert module or custom modules for complex tests

- **Maintaining Compliance Standards**: The InSpec tests reference specific compliance standards (e.g., SRG-OS-000112)
  - Mitigation: Document compliance mappings and ensure Ansible tests maintain the same level of validation

### Migration Order

1. **website_https.yml** (low risk, already Ansible): Review and optimize the existing Ansible playbook
2. **poodle_fix.yml** (low risk, already Ansible): Review and optimize the existing Ansible playbook
3. **InSpec Tests** (moderate complexity): Convert to Ansible-native testing or integrate InSpec with Ansible
4. **Chef Deployment Scripts** (high complexity): Convert bash scripts to Ansible roles for Chef infrastructure deployment

### Assumptions

1. The primary goal is to standardize on Ansible and remove dependencies on Chef where possible
2. InSpec tests may still be valuable and could be maintained separately or called from Ansible
3. The deployment scripts for Chef Automate and Chef Infra Server may be out of scope if the organization is moving away from Chef entirely
4. The hardcoded credentials in the deployment scripts are for demonstration purposes only and would be replaced with secure credential management in production
5. The target environment will continue to be Ubuntu 20.04 or compatible systems
6. The SSL/TLS security requirements will remain the same (TLSv1.2 required, older protocols disabled)
7. The repository is primarily for demonstration purposes rather than production use
