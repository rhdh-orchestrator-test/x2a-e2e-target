# MIGRATION FROM CHEF/ANSIBLE TO ANSIBLE

## Executive Summary

This repository contains a mix of Chef InSpec tests and Ansible playbooks that are used together to demonstrate compliance automation. The primary focus appears to be showing how Chef InSpec can be used alongside Ansible for compliance testing. The repository also contains shell scripts for deploying Chef Automate and Chef Infra Server.

The migration scope is relatively small, as most of the Ansible components are already in place. The main migration effort will involve:
1. Converting Chef InSpec tests to Ansible-native testing solutions
2. Adapting the Chef Automate/Infra Server deployment scripts to Ansible playbooks

Estimated timeline: 1-2 weeks for a complete migration, with minimal complexity due to the small codebase and limited dependencies.

## Module Migration Plan

This repository contains Chef InSpec tests and Ansible playbooks that need individual migration planning:

### MODULE INVENTORY

    - Path: chef-and-ansible/tests/website_https_verify.rb
    - Technology: Chef InSpec
    - Key Features: Port listening check, HTTPS response validation, SSL protocol verification

- **ssh_profile**:
    - Description: Chef InSpec control that verifies SSH root login is disabled for security compliance
    - Path: chef-and-ansible/tests/ssh_profile.rb
    - Technology: Chef InSpec
    - Key Features: SSH configuration validation, security compliance check with STIG references

- **chef-automate-deploy**:
    - Description: Bash script to deploy Chef Automate and Chef Infra Server
    - Path: setup-automate/deploy-automate.sh
    - Technology: Bash
    - Key Features: Chef Automate installation, user and organization creation

- **chef-server-deploy**:
    - Description: Bash script to deploy Chef Infra Server without Automate
    - Path: setup-automate/deploy-chef-server.sh
    - Technology: Bash
    - Key Features: Chef Infra Server installation, user and organization creation

### Infrastructure Files

- `kitchen.yml`: Test Kitchen configuration for running Ansible playbooks and InSpec tests
- `index.html`: Simple HTML file used as a test page for the web server

### Target Details

Based on the source configuration files:

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04 (explicitly specified in kitchen.yml)
- **Virtual Machine Technology**: Vagrant (specified in kitchen.yml driver)
- **Cloud Platform**: Not specified, appears to be designed for on-premises or generic cloud VMs

## Migration Approach

### Key Dependencies to Address

- **Chef InSpec**: Replace with Ansible-native testing solutions:
  - Option 1: Use Ansible's `assert` module for basic testing
  - Option 2: Integrate with Molecule for more comprehensive testing
  - Option 3: Use ansible-lint for static analysis
  - Option 4: Consider Ansible's built-in `--check` mode for validation

- **Test Kitchen**: Replace with:
  - Molecule for Ansible role testing
  - Ansible's built-in inventory management for multi-node testing

### Security Considerations

- **SSL Configuration**: The migration must maintain the security hardening in the poodle_fix.yml playbook
  - Ensure TLSv1.2 remains enabled and older protocols remain disabled
  - Consider updating to also include TLSv1.3 support

- **SSH Security**: Maintain the SSH root login restrictions verified by the InSpec test
  - Convert the InSpec control to an Ansible task that enforces the same policy
  - Include idempotent checks to verify the configuration

- **Vault/secrets management**:
  - Hardcoded credentials in setup scripts (username, password) should be moved to Ansible Vault
  - Self-signed certificates should be managed securely
  - Count of credentials detected: 3 (username, password, and SSL certificates)

### Technical Challenges

- **InSpec to Ansible Testing**: Converting InSpec's declarative testing syntax to Ansible's procedural approach
  - Mitigation: Use Ansible's assert module with appropriate conditionals to replicate InSpec tests
  - Consider using community.general.test module for more advanced testing capabilities

- **Chef Automate Deployment**: Replacing the Chef Automate deployment scripts with Ansible
  - Mitigation: Create an Ansible role that performs the same setup steps
  - Consider using official Chef Ansible roles if available

### Migration Order

1. **website_https.yml** (already in Ansible format, low risk)
2. **poodle_fix.yml** (already in Ansible format, low risk)
3. **InSpec Tests** (convert to Ansible testing framework, moderate complexity)
4. **Chef Deployment Scripts** (convert to Ansible playbooks, higher complexity)

### Assumptions

1. The primary goal is to eliminate Chef InSpec dependency while maintaining the same level of compliance testing
2. The existing Ansible playbooks (website_https.yml, poodle_fix.yml) are working correctly and don't need functional changes
3. The deployment scripts for Chef Automate/Infra Server will be replaced with Ansible playbooks that deploy alternative solutions or the same Chef products but managed through Ansible
4. Test Kitchen is used only for development/testing and not in production pipelines
5. There are no external dependencies or integrations not visible in the provided files
6. The hardcoded credentials in the deployment scripts are for demonstration purposes only and would be replaced with secure alternatives in the migration
