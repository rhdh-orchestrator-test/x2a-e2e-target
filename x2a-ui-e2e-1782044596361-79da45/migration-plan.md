# MIGRATION FROM CHEF/ANSIBLE TO ANSIBLE

## Executive Summary

This repository contains a mix of Chef InSpec tests and Ansible playbooks that are used together to demonstrate compliance automation. The primary focus appears to be showing how Chef InSpec can be used alongside Ansible for compliance testing. Additionally, there are bash scripts for deploying Chef Automate and Chef Infra Server.

The migration scope is relatively small, as most of the Ansible components are already in place. The main migration effort will involve:
1. Converting Chef InSpec tests to Ansible-native testing solutions
2. Replacing Chef Automate/Infra Server deployment scripts with Ansible playbooks
3. Ensuring all compliance checks are maintained during migration

Estimated timeline: 1-2 weeks for a small team (1-2 engineers)

## Module Migration Plan

This repository contains Chef InSpec tests and Ansible playbooks that need individual migration planning:

### MODULE INVENTORY

- **website_https**:
    - Description: Ansible playbook that sets up an Apache web server with HTTPS support using self-signed certificates

    - Technology: Ansible
    - Key Features: Apache configuration, SSL certificate generation, virtual host setup

- **poodle_fix**:
    - Description: Ansible playbook that addresses the POODLE vulnerability by disabling SSLv3 and enabling only TLSv1.2
    - Path: chef-and-ansible/poodle_fix.yml
    - Technology: Ansible
    - Key Features: Apache SSL configuration hardening, service restart handlers

- **website_https_verify**:
    - Description: Chef InSpec test that verifies HTTPS functionality and security
    - Path: chef-and-ansible/tests/website_https_verify.rb
    - Technology: Chef InSpec
    - Key Features: Port listening check, HTTPS response validation, SSL protocol verification

- **ssh_profile**:
    - Description: Chef InSpec control that verifies SSH root login is disabled (security compliance check)
    - Path: chef-and-ansible/tests/ssh_profile.rb
    - Technology: Chef InSpec
    - Key Features: SSH configuration validation, security tagging (STIG/CCI references)

- **chef-automate-deploy**:
    - Description: Bash script to deploy Chef Automate and Chef Infra Server
    - Path: setup-automate/deploy-automate.sh
    - Technology: Bash/Chef
    - Key Features: Chef Automate installation, user and organization creation

- **chef-server-deploy**:
    - Description: Bash script to deploy Chef Infra Server without Automate
    - Path: setup-automate/deploy-chef-server.sh
    - Technology: Bash/Chef
    - Key Features: Chef Infra Server installation, user and organization creation

### Infrastructure Files

- `kitchen.yml`: Test Kitchen configuration for running Ansible playbooks and InSpec tests. Migration considerations include replacing with Ansible-native testing frameworks.
- `index.html`: Simple HTML file used for testing web server functionality. Can be directly used in Ansible without changes.

### Target Details

Based on the source configuration files:

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04 (explicitly specified in kitchen.yml)
- **Virtual Machine Technology**: Vagrant (specified in kitchen.yml driver)
- **Cloud Platform**: Not specified, appears to be platform-agnostic with potential for on-premises or cloud deployment (based on setup-automate scripts)

## Migration Approach

### Key Dependencies to Address

- **Chef InSpec**: Replace with Ansible-native testing solutions:
  - Option 1: Use Ansible's `assert` module for basic compliance checks
  - Option 2: Integrate with Molecule for more comprehensive testing
  - Option 3: Use ansible-lint for static analysis of playbooks
  - Option 4: Consider integrating with OpenSCAP for advanced compliance testing

- **Test Kitchen**: Replace with Molecule for Ansible playbook testing

### Security Considerations

- **SSL/TLS Configuration**: The migration must maintain the security hardening in the poodle_fix.yml playbook
  - Approach: Ensure the same SSL protocol restrictions are applied in the migrated Ansible playbooks
  
- **SSH Security Controls**: The SSH root login check must be preserved
  - Approach: Convert the InSpec control to an Ansible task that verifies the same configuration

- **Vault/secrets management**:
  - Hardcoded credentials in setup scripts (username, password) should be moved to Ansible Vault
  - Count: 2 credential sets in deploy-automate.sh and deploy-chef-server.sh

### Technical Challenges

- **InSpec to Ansible Testing**: Converting InSpec's declarative testing syntax to Ansible's procedural approach
  - Mitigation: Use Ansible's assert module with carefully crafted conditions that match InSpec's intent
  
- **Compliance Tagging**: InSpec tests include rich metadata (STIG IDs, CCI references) that need preservation
  - Mitigation: Use Ansible task tags and documentation to maintain compliance metadata

- **Chef Automate Functionality**: Replacing Chef Automate's compliance reporting capabilities
  - Mitigation: Consider integrating with AWX/Tower for reporting or explore other compliance platforms

### Migration Order

1. **website_https.yml** (already in Ansible, no migration needed)
2. **poodle_fix.yml** (already in Ansible, no migration needed)
3. **website_https_verify.rb** (convert InSpec tests to Ansible assertions)
4. **ssh_profile.rb** (convert InSpec control to Ansible task)
5. **deploy-automate.sh** and **deploy-chef-server.sh** (convert to Ansible roles for infrastructure deployment)

### Assumptions

1. The primary goal is to move away from Chef InSpec while maintaining the same level of compliance testing
2. The existing Ansible playbooks (website_https.yml, poodle_fix.yml) are working correctly and don't need functional changes
3. There's no requirement to maintain backward compatibility with Chef Automate/Infra Server
4. The hardcoded credentials in the deployment scripts are for demonstration purposes only and will be properly secured in the migrated solution
5. The compliance checks (especially in ssh_profile.rb) are still relevant and should be preserved
6. Test Kitchen is currently used for testing the integration between Ansible and InSpec
