# MIGRATION FROM CHEF/ANSIBLE TO ANSIBLE

## Executive Summary

This repository contains a mix of Chef InSpec tests and Ansible playbooks that are used together to demonstrate compliance automation. The migration scope is relatively small, focusing on converting Chef InSpec tests to Ansible-compatible testing frameworks while preserving the existing Ansible playbooks. The repository also contains Chef Automate and Chef Infra Server deployment scripts that need to be converted to Ansible playbooks.

Estimated timeline: 1-2 weeks for a single developer, considering the limited scope and complexity.

## Module Migration Plan

This repository contains Chef InSpec tests and Ansible playbooks that need individual migration planning:

### MODULE INVENTORY

- **poodle_fix**:
    - Description: Ansible playbook that fixes SSL vulnerabilities in Apache by disabling older protocols
    - Path: chef-and-ansible/poodle_fix.yml
    - Technology: Ansible
    - Key Features: Apache SSL configuration hardening, service restart handlers

- **website_https_verify**:
    - Description: Chef InSpec test that verifies HTTPS functionality and security
    - Path: chef-and-ansible/tests/website_https_verify.rb
    - Technology: Chef InSpec
    - Key Features: Port listening check, HTTPS response validation, SSL protocol security verification

- **ssh_profile**:
    - Description: Chef InSpec control that verifies SSH root login is disabled for security compliance
    - Path: chef-and-ansible/tests/ssh_profile.rb
    - Technology: Chef InSpec
    - Key Features: SSH configuration validation, security compliance check with STIG references

- **chef-automate-deployment**:
    - Description: Bash script for deploying Chef Automate and Chef Infra Server
    - Path: setup-automate/deploy-automate.sh
    - Technology: Bash/Chef
    - Key Features: Chef Automate installation, Chef Server configuration, user and organization setup

- **chef-server-deployment**:
    - Description: Bash script for deploying Chef Infra Server without Automate
    - Path: setup-automate/deploy-chef-server.sh
    - Technology: Bash/Chef
    - Key Features: Chef Server installation, user and organization setup

### Infrastructure Files

- `kitchen.yml`: Test Kitchen configuration for running Ansible playbooks and InSpec tests. Migration considerations include replacing with Ansible-native testing frameworks like Molecule.
- `index.html`: Simple HTML file used for testing web server functionality. No migration needed.

### Target Details

Analyze the source repository to determine target environment specifications:

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04 (explicitly specified in kitchen.yml)
- **Virtual Machine Technology**: Vagrant (specified in kitchen.yml driver)
- **Cloud Platform**: Not specified, appears to be targeting on-premises or generic cloud VMs

## Migration Approach

### Key Dependencies to Address

- **Chef InSpec**: Replace with Ansible-compatible testing frameworks:
  - Option 1: Use Ansible's built-in `assert` module for basic testing
  - Option 2: Integrate with Molecule for more comprehensive testing
  - Option 3: Use pytest-ansible for Python-based testing
  - Option 4: Consider Ansible Lint for static analysis

- **Test Kitchen**: Replace with Molecule for Ansible role testing

- **Chef Automate/Infra Server**: Replace with:
  - Ansible AWX/Tower for web UI and job scheduling
  - GitLab CI/Jenkins for pipeline integration
  - Compliance scanning tools like OpenSCAP or Ansible's built-in security roles

### Security Considerations

- **SSL Configuration**: The migration must preserve the SSL hardening in the poodle_fix.yml playbook
  - Approach: Maintain the same configuration parameters in the Ansible playbooks

- **SSH Hardening**: The SSH security controls in ssh_profile.rb need to be implemented in Ansible
  - Approach: Create an Ansible role that applies the same SSH hardening controls

- **Vault/secrets management**:
  - Hardcoded credentials in setup scripts (username, password) should be moved to Ansible Vault
  - Self-signed certificates should be managed securely

### Technical Challenges

- **InSpec to Ansible Testing**: Converting InSpec tests to Ansible-compatible testing frameworks
  - Mitigation: Use Ansible's assert module for basic tests and consider more advanced frameworks like Molecule for complex tests

- **Chef Server Deployment**: Replacing Chef Server deployment with equivalent Ansible functionality
  - Mitigation: Implement Ansible AWX/Tower deployment playbooks and integrate with version control

### Migration Order

1. **Ansible Playbooks** (website_https.yml, poodle_fix.yml): Low risk as they're already in Ansible format, just need review and potential refactoring
2. **InSpec Tests** (website_https_verify.rb, ssh_profile.rb): Convert to Ansible-compatible testing frameworks
3. **Chef Deployment Scripts** (deploy-automate.sh, deploy-chef-server.sh): Convert to Ansible playbooks for infrastructure deployment

### Assumptions

1. The primary purpose of this repository is to demonstrate how Chef InSpec can be used alongside Ansible for compliance automation, as indicated in the README.
2. The existing Ansible playbooks (website_https.yml, poodle_fix.yml) are functioning correctly and don't require significant changes.
3. The target environment is Ubuntu 20.04 running on Vagrant VMs, but the solution should be adaptable to other environments.
4. The hardcoded credentials in the deployment scripts are for demonstration purposes only and would be replaced with secure credential management in production.
5. The Chef Automate and Chef Infra Server deployment scripts are intended for development/testing environments and not production use.
6. The migration will focus on preserving functionality while moving away from Chef-specific components.
