# MIGRATION FROM CHEF/ANSIBLE TO ANSIBLE

## Executive Summary

This repository contains a mix of Chef InSpec tests and Ansible playbooks that are used together to demonstrate compliance automation. The primary focus appears to be showing how Chef InSpec can be used alongside Ansible for compliance testing. Additionally, there are bash scripts for deploying Chef Automate and Chef Infra Server.

The migration scope is relatively small, as most of the Ansible components are already in place. The main migration effort will involve:
1. Converting Chef InSpec tests to Ansible-native testing solutions
2. Migrating Chef Automate/Infra Server deployment scripts to Ansible playbooks

**Estimated Timeline**: 1-2 weeks for a small team (1-2 engineers)
**Complexity**: Low to Medium

## Module Migration Plan

This repository contains Chef InSpec tests and Ansible playbooks that need individual migration planning:

### MODULE INVENTORY

    - Path: chef-and-ansible/poodle_fix.yml
    - Technology: Ansible

- **website_https_verify**:
    - Description: Chef InSpec test that verifies HTTPS functionality and security
    - Path: chef-and-ansible/tests/website_https_verify.rb
    - Technology: Chef InSpec
    - Key Features: Port listening check, HTTPS response validation, SSL protocol verification

- **ssh_profile**:
    - Description: Chef InSpec test that verifies SSH security configuration
    - Path: chef-and-ansible/tests/ssh_profile.rb
    - Technology: Chef InSpec
    - Key Features: SSH root login check, compliance with security standards (STIG)

- **chef-automate-deployment**:
    - Description: Bash script to deploy Chef Automate and Chef Infra Server
    - Path: setup-automate/deploy-automate.sh
    - Technology: Bash
    - Key Features: Chef Automate installation, user and organization creation

- **chef-server-deployment**:
    - Description: Bash script to deploy Chef Infra Server without Automate
    - Path: setup-automate/deploy-chef-server.sh
    - Technology: Bash
    - Key Features: Chef Infra Server installation, user and organization creation

### Infrastructure Files

- `kitchen.yml`: Test Kitchen configuration for running Ansible playbooks and InSpec tests
- `index.html`: Simple HTML file used as a test page for the web server

### Target Details

Based on the source configuration files:

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04 (explicitly specified in kitchen.yml)
- **Virtual Machine Technology**: Vagrant (specified in kitchen.yml driver)
- **Cloud Platform**: Not specified, appears to be designed for on-premises or generic cloud VMs

## Migration Approach

### Key Dependencies to Address

- **Chef InSpec**: Replace with Ansible-native testing solutions:
  - Option 1: Use Ansible's assert module for basic testing
  - Option 2: Integrate with Molecule for more comprehensive testing
  - Option 3: Use ansible-lint for static analysis
  - Option 4: Consider using the ansible.builtin.uri module to replace HTTP tests

- **Test Kitchen**: Replace with:
  - Molecule for Ansible role testing
  - Or continue using Test Kitchen with the kitchen-ansible plugin

### Security Considerations

- **SSL Configuration**: The migration must maintain the security hardening in the poodle_fix.yml playbook
  - Ensure TLSv1.2 is enforced and older protocols are disabled
  - Consider updating to also include TLSv1.3 support

- **SSH Security**: Maintain the SSH security controls verified by the InSpec tests
  - Ensure root login remains disabled
  - Consider adding more SSH hardening based on current best practices

- **Vault/secrets management**:
  - Hardcoded credentials in setup scripts (username, password) should be moved to Ansible Vault
  - Self-signed certificates should be managed securely
  - Count of credentials detected: 3 (username, password, and SSL certificates)

### Technical Challenges

- **InSpec to Ansible Testing**: Converting InSpec tests to Ansible-native testing will require careful mapping of test assertions
  - Challenge: InSpec has specialized resources for testing SSL/TLS configurations
  - Mitigation: May need to use custom Ansible modules or shell commands with assert

- **Chef Server Deployment**: Converting the Chef server deployment scripts to Ansible
  - Challenge: The scripts perform specific Chef server configuration steps
  - Mitigation: Create Ansible roles that replicate the Chef server setup process

### Migration Order

1. **website_https.yml** (already in Ansible, no migration needed)
2. **poodle_fix.yml** (already in Ansible, no migration needed)
3. **InSpec Tests** (convert to Ansible testing framework)
   - website_https_verify.rb
   - ssh_profile.rb
4. **Chef Deployment Scripts** (convert to Ansible playbooks)
   - deploy-automate.sh
   - deploy-chef-server.sh
5. **Test Kitchen Configuration** (convert to Molecule)

### Assumptions

1. The primary goal is to eliminate Chef InSpec dependencies and move to a pure Ansible solution
2. The existing Ansible playbooks (website_https.yml, poodle_fix.yml) are working correctly and don't need modification
3. The target environment will continue to be Ubuntu 20.04 or compatible
4. The deployment scripts for Chef Automate/Infra Server need to be migrated to Ansible (rather than eliminated)
5. The security requirements represented in the InSpec tests need to be maintained in the Ansible solution
6. No external data sources or integrations are present beyond what's visible in the repository
7. The migration will maintain the same level of security compliance checking currently provided by InSpec
