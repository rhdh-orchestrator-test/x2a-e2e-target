# MIGRATION FROM CHEF/ANSIBLE TO ANSIBLE

## Executive Summary

This repository contains a mix of Chef InSpec tests and Ansible playbooks that are used together to demonstrate compliance automation. The primary focus appears to be showing how Chef InSpec can be used alongside Ansible for compliance testing. The repository also includes shell scripts for deploying Chef Automate and Chef Infra Server.

The migration scope is relatively small, as most of the Ansible components are already in place. The primary migration tasks will involve:
1. Converting Chef InSpec tests to Ansible-native testing solutions
2. Migrating Chef Automate/Infra Server deployment scripts to Ansible playbooks

Estimated timeline: 1-2 weeks for a complete migration, with minimal complexity due to the limited scope of Chef components.

## Module Migration Plan

This repository contains Chef InSpec tests and Ansible playbooks that need individual migration planning:

### MODULE INVENTORY

    - Path: chef-and-ansible/tests/website_https_verify.rb
    - Technology: Chef InSpec
    - Key Features: Port listening check, HTTPS response validation, SSL protocol verification

- **ssh_profile**:
    - Description: Chef InSpec control that verifies SSH root login is disabled for security compliance
    - Path: chef-and-ansible/tests/ssh_profile.rb
    - Technology: Chef InSpec
    - Key Features: SSH configuration validation, security compliance check with STIG references

    - Path: setup-automate/deploy-automate.sh
    - Technology: Bash/Chef
    - Key Features: Chef Automate installation, Chef Infra Server configuration, user and organization setup

- **chef-server-deploy**:
    - Description: Bash script for deploying Chef Infra Server without Automate
    - Path: setup-automate/deploy-chef-server.sh
    - Technology: Bash/Chef
    - Key Features: Chef Infra Server installation, user and organization setup

### Infrastructure Files

- `kitchen.yml`: Test Kitchen configuration for running Ansible playbooks and InSpec tests. Migration consideration: Replace with Ansible-native testing framework like Molecule.
- `index.html`: Simple HTML file used for testing. Migration consideration: Can be kept as-is or included as a template in Ansible.

### Target Details

Based on the source configuration files:

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04 (explicitly specified in kitchen.yml)
- **Virtual Machine Technology**: Vagrant (specified in kitchen.yml driver)
- **Cloud Platform**: Not specified, appears to be platform-agnostic with potential for on-premises or cloud deployment (based on comments in setup scripts)

## Migration Approach

### Key Dependencies to Address

- **Chef InSpec**: Replace with Ansible-native testing solutions:
  - Option 1: Use Ansible's assert module for basic compliance checks
  - Option 2: Integrate with Ansible Lint for static analysis
  - Option 3: Use Molecule for comprehensive testing
  - Option 4: Consider integrating with OpenSCAP for STIG compliance checks

- **Test Kitchen**: Replace with Molecule for Ansible role testing

- **Chef Automate/Infra Server**: Replace deployment scripts with Ansible playbooks that can:
  - Set up equivalent monitoring and compliance solutions
  - Consider AWX/Ansible Tower as a replacement for Chef Automate's dashboard functionality

### Security Considerations

- **SSL Configuration**: The migration must maintain the security hardening in the poodle_fix.yml playbook
  - Approach: Ensure the same SSL protocol restrictions are applied in the migrated solution

- **SSH Security**: The SSH root login compliance check must be preserved
  - Approach: Convert the InSpec control to an Ansible task that performs the same validation

- **Vault/secrets management**:
  - Hardcoded credentials in setup-automate scripts (username, password)
  - Approach: Replace with Ansible Vault for secure credential storage

### Technical Challenges

- **InSpec to Ansible Testing**: Converting InSpec's declarative testing syntax to Ansible's procedural approach
  - Mitigation: Use Ansible's assert module with carefully crafted conditions that match InSpec's intent

- **Compliance Reporting**: InSpec provides rich compliance reporting that needs to be replicated
  - Mitigation: Consider integrating with OpenSCAP or using Ansible Tower/AWX for compliance reporting

### Migration Order

1. **website_https.yml** (already in Ansible, no migration needed)
2. **poodle_fix.yml** (already in Ansible, no migration needed)
3. **website_https_verify.rb** (convert InSpec tests to Ansible assertions)
4. **ssh_profile.rb** (convert InSpec control to Ansible task)
5. **deploy-automate.sh** and **deploy-chef-server.sh** (convert to Ansible playbooks)

### Assumptions

1. The primary purpose of this repository is to demonstrate Chef InSpec with Ansible rather than being a production deployment
2. The hardcoded credentials in the setup scripts are for demonstration purposes only
3. There are no external dependencies or integrations not visible in the repository
4. The target environment is Ubuntu 20.04 running on Vagrant VMs
5. The migration will maintain the same level of security compliance checking
6. No custom Chef resources or complex Chef-specific functionality is being used
