# MIGRATION FROM CHEF INSPEC AND ANSIBLE TO ANSIBLE

## Executive Summary

This repository contains a combination of Ansible playbooks and Chef InSpec tests that demonstrate how to use Chef InSpec for compliance testing alongside Ansible for configuration management. The migration scope is relatively small, focusing on converting the InSpec tests to Ansible-compatible testing frameworks while preserving the existing Ansible playbooks. Additionally, there are Chef Automate and Chef Infra Server deployment scripts that need to be converted to Ansible playbooks.

**Estimated Timeline**: 1-2 weeks for a single developer, including testing and documentation.

## Module Migration Plan

This repository contains Ansible playbooks and Chef InSpec tests that need individual migration planning:

### MODULE INVENTORY

    - Technology: Chef InSpec
    - Key Features: Port listening check, HTTPS response validation, SSL protocol verification

- **ssh_profile**:
    - Description: Chef InSpec control that verifies SSH root login is disabled for security compliance
    - Path: chef-and-ansible/tests/ssh_profile.rb
    - Technology: Chef InSpec
    - Key Features: SSH configuration validation, security compliance check with STIG references

    - Path: setup-automate/deploy-automate.sh
    - Technology: Bash/Chef
    - Key Features: Chef Automate installation, Chef Server configuration, user and organization setup

- **chef-server-deployment**:
    - Description: Bash script for deploying Chef Infra Server without Automate
    - Path: setup-automate/deploy-chef-server.sh
    - Technology: Bash/Chef
    - Key Features: Chef Server installation, user and organization setup

### Infrastructure Files

- `kitchen.yml`: Test Kitchen configuration for running Ansible playbooks and InSpec tests. Will need to be replaced with Ansible-native testing framework configuration.
- `index.html`: Simple HTML file used for testing the web server deployment.

### Target Details

Based on the source configuration files:

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04 (explicitly specified in kitchen.yml)
- **Virtual Machine Technology**: Vagrant (specified in kitchen.yml driver)
- **Cloud Platform**: Not specified, but the deployment scripts suggest they could be used in cloud environments

## Migration Approach

### Key Dependencies to Address

- **Chef InSpec**: Replace with Ansible-compatible testing frameworks:
  - Option 1: Use Ansible's built-in `assert` module for basic testing
  - Option 2: Integrate with Molecule for more comprehensive testing
  - Option 3: Use pytest-ansible for Python-based testing

- **Test Kitchen**: Replace with Molecule for Ansible role testing

- **Chef Automate/Infra Server**: Replace with:
  - Ansible AWX/Tower for web UI and job scheduling
  - GitLab CI/CD or Jenkins for pipeline automation
  - Compliance scanning tools like OpenSCAP or Ansible's built-in security roles

### Security Considerations

- **SSL Configuration**: The migration must preserve the security hardening in the poodle_fix.yml playbook
- **SSH Hardening**: The SSH security controls from the InSpec test should be implemented as Ansible tasks
- **Credentials Management**: 
  - The Chef deployment scripts contain hardcoded credentials that should be moved to Ansible Vault
  - Count: 3 credential sets (username, password, email) in each deployment script

### Technical Challenges

- **InSpec to Ansible Testing**: Converting InSpec's declarative testing syntax to Ansible's procedural approach will require careful mapping of test assertions
  - Mitigation: Create custom Ansible modules or use assert with appropriate conditionals to match InSpec's behavior

- **Compliance Reporting**: InSpec provides rich compliance reporting that needs to be replicated
  - Mitigation: Integrate with tools like OpenSCAP or use Ansible's json_query to format compliance results

- **Chef Server Functionality**: Replacing Chef Server's functionality with Ansible equivalents
  - Mitigation: Use Ansible AWX/Tower for web UI and job scheduling, GitLab/Jenkins for CI/CD pipelines

### Migration Order

1. **Ansible Playbooks** (website_https.yml, poodle_fix.yml): Low risk as they can remain largely unchanged
2. **InSpec Tests** (website_https_verify.rb, ssh_profile.rb): Convert to Ansible-compatible testing framework
3. **Chef Deployment Scripts** (deploy-automate.sh, deploy-chef-server.sh): Convert to Ansible playbooks
4. **Test Kitchen Configuration** (kitchen.yml): Replace with Molecule configuration

### Assumptions

1. The target environment will continue to be Ubuntu 20.04 or compatible Linux distributions
2. The team has expertise in Ansible or will receive training
3. There are no additional Chef cookbooks or resources not visible in the provided repository structure
4. The InSpec tests are used primarily for validation and not as part of a larger compliance framework
5. The deployment scripts are used for setting up development/test environments and not production systems (given the hardcoded credentials)
6. The migration does not need to preserve Chef-specific functionality like Chef Server or Automate dashboards
7. The existing Ansible playbooks can be used with minimal modifications
