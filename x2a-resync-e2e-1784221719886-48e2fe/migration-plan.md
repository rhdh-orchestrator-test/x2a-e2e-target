# MIGRATION FROM CHEF INSPEC AND ANSIBLE TO ANSIBLE

## Executive Summary

This repository contains a combination of Chef InSpec tests and Ansible playbooks that are used together to deploy and validate secure web server configurations. The migration scope is relatively small, focusing on converting Chef InSpec tests to Ansible-native testing solutions while preserving the existing Ansible playbooks. Additionally, there are Chef Automate and Chef Infra Server deployment scripts that need to be converted to Ansible playbooks.

**Estimated Timeline**: 1-2 weeks for a single developer, including testing and documentation.
**Complexity**: Low to Medium - The repository contains a limited number of files with straightforward functionality.

## Module Migration Plan

This repository contains Chef InSpec tests and Ansible playbooks that need individual migration planning:

### MODULE INVENTORY

    - Path: chef-and-ansible/tests/ssh_profile.rb
    - Technology: Chef InSpec
    - Key Features: SSH root login security check with STIG compliance metadata

- **chef-automate-deployment**:

- **chef-server-deployment**:
    - Description: Bash script that deploys Chef Infra Server without Automate
    - Path: setup-automate/deploy-chef-server.sh
    - Technology: Bash/Chef
    - Key Features: Chef Infra Server installation, user and organization creation

### Infrastructure Files

- `kitchen.yml`: Test Kitchen configuration for running Ansible playbooks and validating with InSpec tests
- `index.html`: Simple HTML file used as a template for the website deployment

### Target Details

Based on the source configuration files:

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04 (explicitly specified in kitchen.yml)
- **Virtual Machine Technology**: Vagrant (specified in kitchen.yml driver)
- **Cloud Platform**: Not specified, but scripts are designed to work on both on-premises and cloud VMs

## Migration Approach

### Key Dependencies to Address

- **Chef InSpec**: Replace with Ansible-native testing solutions:
  - Option 1: Use the `ansible.builtin.assert` module for simple validations
  - Option 2: Implement Molecule for more comprehensive testing
  - Option 3: Use pytest-ansible for Python-based testing

- **Test Kitchen**: Replace with Molecule for Ansible role and playbook testing

- **Chef Automate/Infra Server**: Replace with:
  - Ansible AWX/Tower for web UI and job scheduling
  - GitLab CI/CD or Jenkins for pipeline automation
  - Ansible Vault for secrets management

### Security Considerations

- **SSL/TLS Configuration**: The migration must preserve the security hardening in the poodle_fix.yml playbook
  - Approach: Convert the InSpec tests to Ansible assert tasks that validate the same security controls

- **SSH Security**: The SSH security controls tested by the InSpec profile need to be implemented and tested in Ansible
  - Approach: Create an Ansible role for SSH hardening that implements the same controls

- **Vault/secrets management**:
  - Hardcoded credentials in setup scripts (username, password) should be moved to Ansible Vault
  - Count: 2 credential sets in deploy-automate.sh and deploy-chef-server.sh

### Technical Challenges

- **InSpec to Ansible Testing**: Converting the InSpec tests to Ansible-native testing will require careful mapping of InSpec resources to Ansible modules
  - Mitigation: Create a mapping document for InSpec resources to Ansible modules and use assert or custom modules where direct equivalents don't exist

- **Chef Automate Functionality**: Replacing Chef Automate's functionality with Ansible-native tools
  - Mitigation: Document the specific Chef Automate features being used and identify Ansible equivalents or complementary tools

### Migration Order

1. **Ansible Playbooks** (website_https.yml, poodle_fix.yml): Low risk as they can remain largely unchanged
2. **InSpec Tests** (website_https_verify.rb, ssh_profile.rb): Convert to Ansible-native testing
3. **Chef Deployment Scripts** (deploy-automate.sh, deploy-chef-server.sh): Convert to Ansible playbooks
4. **Test Infrastructure** (kitchen.yml): Replace with Molecule configuration

### Assumptions

1. The current setup uses Chef InSpec primarily for testing/validation rather than for configuration management
2. The target environment will continue to be Ubuntu 20.04 running on Vagrant VMs
3. There are no additional Chef cookbooks or recipes beyond what's visible in the repository
4. The hardcoded credentials in the deployment scripts are for testing purposes only and will be replaced with secure alternatives
5. The self-signed certificates are acceptable for the target environment and don't need to be replaced with CA-signed certificates
6. The Apache configuration in the Ansible playbooks meets the security requirements and doesn't need additional hardening beyond the POODLE fix
7. There are no external dependencies or integrations not visible in the repository files
8. The migration doesn't need to preserve backward compatibility with Chef Automate or Chef Infra Server
