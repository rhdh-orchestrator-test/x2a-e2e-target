# MIGRATION FROM CHEF/ANSIBLE TO ANSIBLE

## Executive Summary

This repository contains a mix of Chef InSpec tests and Ansible playbooks that are used together to demonstrate compliance automation. The primary focus appears to be showing how Chef InSpec can be used alongside Ansible for compliance testing. The repository also contains shell scripts for deploying Chef Automate and Chef Infra Server.

The migration scope is relatively small, as most of the Ansible components are already in place. The primary migration tasks will involve:
1. Converting Chef InSpec tests to Ansible-native testing solutions
2. Migrating Chef Automate/Infra Server deployment scripts to Ansible playbooks
3. Ensuring all compliance checks are preserved in the new implementation

Estimated timeline: 1-2 weeks for a complete migration, with minimal complexity due to the small codebase and limited dependencies.

## Module Migration Plan

This repository contains Chef InSpec tests and Ansible playbooks that need individual migration planning:

### MODULE INVENTORY

- **poodle_fix**:
    - Description: Ansible playbook that fixes SSL configuration in Apache to mitigate POODLE vulnerability
    - Path: chef-and-ansible/poodle_fix.yml
    - Technology: Ansible

    - Description: Chef InSpec test that verifies HTTPS functionality and security
    - Path: chef-and-ansible/tests/website_https_verify.rb
    - Technology: Chef InSpec
    - Key Features: Port listening check, HTTPS response validation, SSL/TLS protocol verification

- **ssh_profile**:
    - Description: Chef InSpec control that verifies SSH root login is disabled for security compliance
    - Path: chef-and-ansible/tests/ssh_profile.rb
    - Technology: Chef InSpec
    - Key Features: SSH configuration validation, security compliance check with STIG references

- **chef-automate-deployment**:
    - Description: Bash script to deploy Chef Automate and Chef Infra Server
    - Path: setup-automate/deploy-automate.sh
    - Technology: Bash
    - Key Features: Chef Automate installation, user and organization creation

- **chef-server-deployment**:
    - Description: Bash script to deploy Chef Infra Server without Automate
    - Path: setup-automate/deploy-chef-server.sh
    - Technology: Bash
    - Key Features: Chef Infra Server installation, user and organization creation

### Infrastructure Files

- `kitchen.yml`: Test Kitchen configuration for running Ansible playbooks and InSpec tests. Migration considerations include replacing with Ansible-native testing frameworks like Molecule.
- `index.html`: Simple HTML file used for testing web server functionality. Can be preserved as-is or included as a template in Ansible.

### Target Details

Based on the source configuration files:

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04 (explicitly specified in kitchen.yml)
- **Virtual Machine Technology**: Vagrant (specified in kitchen.yml driver)
- **Cloud Platform**: Not specified, appears to be platform-agnostic with potential for on-premises or cloud deployment (based on comments in setup scripts)

## Migration Approach

### Key Dependencies to Address

- **Chef InSpec**: Replace with Ansible-native testing solutions:
  - Option 1: Use Ansible's assert module for basic compliance checks
  - Option 2: Integrate with Ansible Lint for static analysis
  - Option 3: Use Molecule for comprehensive testing
  - Option 4: Consider OpenSCAP integration for STIG compliance checks

- **Test Kitchen**: Replace with Molecule for Ansible role and playbook testing

### Security Considerations

- **SSL/TLS Configuration**: The migration must preserve the security hardening in the poodle_fix.yml playbook that disables SSLv3 and enables only TLSv1.2.
- **SSH Security**: The SSH root login check must be preserved in the Ansible implementation.
- **Self-signed Certificates**: The certificate generation process should be maintained or improved in the Ansible implementation.
- **Vault/secrets management**: 
  - Hardcoded credentials in setup scripts (username, password) should be moved to Ansible Vault
  - Count: 2 credential sets detected in deploy-automate.sh and deploy-chef-server.sh

### Technical Challenges

- **InSpec to Ansible Testing**: Converting InSpec tests to Ansible-native testing solutions while maintaining the same level of compliance validation.
  - Mitigation: Use Ansible's assert module combined with command/shell modules to run equivalent checks, or consider integrating with tools like OpenSCAP.

- **Chef Automate Deployment**: Converting the Chef Automate and Chef Infra Server deployment scripts to Ansible playbooks.
  - Mitigation: Create Ansible roles for Chef server deployment, using the uri module to download packages and the command module for Chef-specific commands.

### Migration Order

1. **website_https.yml** and **poodle_fix.yml** (already in Ansible format, low risk)
2. **InSpec Tests** (moderate complexity, convert to Ansible testing framework)
3. **Chef Deployment Scripts** (higher complexity, requires creating new Ansible roles)

### Assumptions

1. The primary purpose of this repository is to demonstrate how Chef InSpec can be used alongside Ansible for compliance testing, rather than being a production deployment.
2. The target environment is Ubuntu 20.04 running on Vagrant VMs, but the solution should be adaptable to other environments.
3. There are no external dependencies or integrations beyond what is explicitly defined in the repository.
4. The hardcoded credentials in the deployment scripts are for demonstration purposes and would be replaced with secure credential management in a production environment.
5. The migration will focus on preserving functionality while moving to Ansible-native solutions where possible.
6. The STIG compliance checks in the ssh_profile.rb are important to preserve in the migrated solution.
