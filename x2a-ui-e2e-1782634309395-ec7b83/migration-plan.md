# MIGRATION FROM CHEF/ANSIBLE TO ANSIBLE

## Executive Summary

This repository contains a mix of Chef InSpec tests and Ansible playbooks that are used together to demonstrate compliance automation. The primary focus appears to be showing how Chef InSpec can be used alongside Ansible for compliance testing. The repository also contains shell scripts for deploying Chef Automate and Chef Infra Server.

The migration scope is relatively small, as most of the Ansible components are already in place. The main migration effort will involve:
1. Converting Chef InSpec tests to Ansible-native testing solutions
2. Migrating Chef Automate/Infra Server deployment scripts to Ansible playbooks
3. Ensuring all compliance checks are preserved in the new implementation

Estimated timeline: 1-2 weeks for a small team (1-2 engineers)

## Module Migration Plan

This repository contains Chef InSpec tests and Ansible playbooks that need individual migration planning:

### MODULE INVENTORY

    - Description: Chef InSpec test that verifies HTTPS functionality and security
    - Path: chef-and-ansible/tests/website_https_verify.rb
    - Technology: Chef InSpec
    - Key Features: Port listening check, HTTPS response validation, SSL protocol verification

- **ssh_profile**:
    - Description: Chef InSpec control that verifies SSH root login is disabled for security compliance
    - Path: chef-and-ansible/tests/ssh_profile.rb
    - Technology: Chef InSpec
    - Key Features: SSH configuration validation, security compliance check with STIG references

- **chef-automate-deploy**:
    - Description: Bash script for deploying Chef Automate and Chef Infra Server
    - Path: setup-automate/deploy-automate.sh
    - Technology: Bash
    - Key Features: Chef Automate installation, user and organization creation

- **chef-server-deploy**:
    - Description: Bash script for deploying Chef Infra Server without Automate
    - Path: setup-automate/deploy-chef-server.sh
    - Technology: Bash
    - Key Features: Chef Infra Server installation, user and organization creation

### Infrastructure Files

- `kitchen.yml`: Test Kitchen configuration for running Ansible playbooks and InSpec tests
- `index.html`: Simple HTML file used as a test page for the web server

### Target Details

Analyze the source repository to determine target environment specifications:

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04 (explicitly specified in kitchen.yml)
- **Virtual Machine Technology**: Vagrant (specified in kitchen.yml as the driver)
- **Cloud Platform**: Not specified, appears to be targeting on-premises or generic cloud VMs

## Migration Approach

### Key Dependencies to Address

- **Chef InSpec**: Replace with Ansible-native testing solutions:
  - Option 1: Use Ansible's assert module for basic testing
  - Option 2: Integrate with Molecule for more comprehensive testing
  - Option 3: Use ansible-lint for static analysis
  - Option 4: Consider using the community.general.inspec module to continue using InSpec tests from within Ansible

- **Test Kitchen**: Replace with:
  - Molecule for Ansible role testing
  - Or continue using Test Kitchen with the kitchen-ansible plugin

### Security Considerations

- **SSL/TLS Configuration**: The migration must preserve the security hardening in the poodle_fix.yml playbook
  - Ensure TLSv1.2 is enforced and older protocols are disabled
  - Maintain the same level of security in the Apache configuration

- **SSH Security**: The SSH root login compliance check must be preserved
  - Convert the InSpec control to an equivalent Ansible check or use ansible-lint rules

- **Credentials Management**: 
  - The deployment scripts contain hardcoded credentials that should be moved to Ansible Vault
  - Count: 2 credentials detected (username/password in both deployment scripts)

### Technical Challenges

- **InSpec to Ansible Testing**: Converting InSpec tests to Ansible-native testing will require careful mapping of test assertions
  - Mitigation: Create a mapping document for InSpec resources to Ansible modules
  - Consider using the community.general.inspec module if direct conversion is challenging

- **Deployment Script Conversion**: The Chef Automate and Chef Infra Server deployment scripts contain specific commands and configurations
  - Mitigation: Research Ansible modules for managing Chef components or consider using the command/shell module with idempotency checks

### Migration Order

1. **website_https.yml** (already in Ansible, low risk)
2. **poodle_fix.yml** (already in Ansible, low risk)
3. **InSpec Tests** (moderate complexity, requires testing framework decisions)
4. **Deployment Scripts** (high complexity, requires Chef-specific knowledge)

### Assumptions

1. The primary goal is to move all functionality to pure Ansible without relying on Chef components
2. The InSpec tests are currently being used for compliance validation and their functionality needs to be preserved
3. The deployment scripts are used for setting up Chef infrastructure, which may be replaced by Ansible-managed infrastructure
4. Test Kitchen is currently used for testing the Ansible playbooks, and a replacement testing framework will be needed
5. The target environment will continue to be Ubuntu 20.04 on Vagrant VMs
6. No external dependencies or integrations beyond what's visible in the repository
7. The hardcoded credentials in the deployment scripts are for demonstration purposes and will need proper secret management in the migrated solution
