Final Validation Report:
All migration tasks have been completed successfully

Validation passed with warnings:
ansible-lint: Passed with 1 warning(s):
[MEDIUM] tasks/system_config.yml:6 [fqcn] You should use canonical module name `ansible.posix.sysctl` instead of `ansible.builtin.sysctl`. (Task/Handler: Configure kernel parameters for Chef Automate)

==============================
Rule Hints (How to Fix):
==============================
# fqcn

Use fully-qualified collection names (FQCN) for all modules to avoid ambiguity.

## Problematic code

```yaml
- name: Create an SSH connection
  shell: ssh ssh_user@{{ ansible_ssh_host }}  # Missing FQCN
```

## Correct code

```yaml
# Option 1: Use ansible.builtin for built-in modules
- name: Create an SSH connection
  ansible.builtin.shell: ssh ssh_user@{{ ansible_ssh_host }}

# Option 2: Use ansible.legacy to allow local overrides
- name: Create an SSH connection
  ansible.legacy.shell: ssh ssh_user@{{ ansible_ssh_host }}
```

Tip: Use `ansible.builtin` for standard modules or `ansible.legacy` if you need local override compatibility.

Review Report:
## Review Summary

### Findings
- [Missing Package Dependencies] Medium: deploy_automate.yml:Extract Chef Automate CLI - Uses gunzip without ensuring gzip package is installed - Fixed
- [Missing Package Dependencies] Medium: deploy_chef_server.yml:Extract Chef Automate CLI - Uses gunzip without ensuring gzip package is installed - Fixed
- [Missing Prerequisites] Medium: user_org_setup.yml:Create Chef user - Uses chef-server-ctl without checking if it's available - Fixed

### Changes Made
- deploy_automate.yml: Added task to ensure gzip package is installed before using gunzip
- deploy_chef_server.yml: Added task to ensure gzip package is installed before using gunzip
- user_org_setup.yml: Added check for chef-server-ctl availability before using it

### No Issues Found
- No Idempotency Failures (all command tasks have proper creates/removes guards)
- No Ordering Issues (tasks are in correct sequence)
- No Invalid Module Parameters
- No Molecule Test Correctness issues (all paths use /tmp/molecule_test/, no become: true, proper tags: molecule-notest)

The role was generally well-structured, with most tasks following Ansible best practices. The main issues found were related to missing package dependencies and prerequisite checks. All command tasks were properly guarded with creates/removes parameters for idempotency, and the molecule tests were correctly configured for container execution. The fixes I made were minimal and focused on ensuring the role would run correctly in all environments.
