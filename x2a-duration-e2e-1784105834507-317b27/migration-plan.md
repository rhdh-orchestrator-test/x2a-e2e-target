# MIGRATION FROM CHEF/ANSIBLE TO ANSIBLE

## Executive Summary

This repository contains a mix of Chef InSpec tests and Ansible playbooks that are used together to demonstrate compliance automation. The migration scope is relatively small, focusing on converting Chef InSpec tests to Ansible-compatible testing frameworks while preserving the existing Ansible playbooks. The repository also contains Chef Automate and Chef Infra Server deployment scripts that need to be converted to Ansible playbooks.

Estimated timeline: 1-2 weeks for a single developer, considering the limited scope and complexity.

## Module Migration Plan

This repository contains Chef InSpec tests and Ansible playbooks that need individual migration planning:

### MODULE INVENTORY

- **poodle_fix**:
    - Description: Ansible playbook that fixes SSL configuration in Apache to mitigate POODLE vulnerability
    - Path: chef-and-ansible/poodle_fix.yml
    - Technology: Ansible

    - Description: Chef InSpec test that verifies HTTPS functionality and security
    - Path: chef-and-ansible/tests/website_https_verify.rb
    - Technology: Chef InSpec
    - Key Features: Port listening check, HTTPS response validation, SSL protocol verification

- **ssh_profile**:
    - Description: Chef InSpec control that ensures SSH root login is disabled for security compliance
    - Path: chef-and-ansible/tests/ssh_profile.rb
    - Technology: Chef InSpec
    - Key Features: SSH configuration validation, compliance with security standards (SRG-OS-000112)

- **chef-automate-deployment**:
    - Description: Bash script for deploying Chef Automate and Chef Infra Server
    - Path: setup-automate/deploy-automate.sh
    - Technology: Bash/Chef
    - Key Features: Chef Automate installation, Chef Server configuration, user and organization creation

- **chef-server-deployment**:
    - Description: Bash script for deploying Chef Infra Server without Automate
    - Path: setup-automate/deploy-chef-server.sh
    - Technology: Bash/Chef
    - Key Features: Chef Server installation, user and organization creation

### Infrastructure Files

- `kitchen.yml`: Test Kitchen configuration for running Ansible playbooks and InSpec tests. Will need to be replaced with Ansible-native testing framework configuration.
- `index.html`: Sample HTML file used for testing the web server deployment.

### Target Details

Based on the source configuration files:

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04 (explicitly specified in kitchen.yml)
- **Virtual Machine Technology**: Vagrant (specified in kitchen.yml driver)
- **Cloud Platform**: Not specified, appears to be infrastructure-agnostic

## Migration Approach

### Key Dependencies to Address

- **Chef InSpec**: Replace with Ansible-compatible testing frameworks:
  - Option 1: Use Ansible's built-in `assert` module for basic testing
  - Option 2: Integrate with Molecule for more comprehensive testing
  - Option 3: Use pytest-ansible for Python-based testing
  - Option 4: Keep InSpec but run it from Ansible using the `command` module

- **Test Kitchen**: Replace with:
  - Option 1: Molecule for Ansible role testing
  - Option 2: Ansible's own testing framework

### Security Considerations

- **SSL Configuration**: The migration must preserve the security hardening in the poodle_fix.yml playbook that disables SSLv3 and enables only TLSv1.2.
- **SSH Security**: The SSH root login compliance check must be maintained in the new testing framework.
- **Self-signed Certificates**: The process for generating self-signed certificates should be preserved or improved.
- **Vault/secrets management**:
  - Hardcoded credentials in setup scripts (username, password) should be moved to Ansible Vault
  - Count: 2 credential sets in deploy-automate.sh and deploy-chef-server.sh

### Technical Challenges

- **InSpec to Ansible Testing**: Converting InSpec tests to Ansible-compatible testing frameworks will require understanding the equivalent assertions and checks.
  - Mitigation: Use Ansible's assert module or integrate with Molecule for testing.

- **Chef Server Deployment**: Converting the Chef Server deployment scripts to Ansible playbooks will require understanding the Chef Server installation process.
  - Mitigation: Create Ansible roles that replicate the Chef Server installation and configuration steps.

### Migration Order

1. **Ansible Playbooks** (website_https.yml, poodle_fix.yml): These are already in Ansible format and require minimal changes, mainly to improve structure and follow best practices.
2. **InSpec Tests** (website_https_verify.rb, ssh_profile.rb): Convert these to Ansible-compatible testing frameworks.
3. **Chef Deployment Scripts** (deploy-automate.sh, deploy-chef-server.sh): Convert these to Ansible playbooks.

### Assumptions

1. The existing Ansible playbooks (website_https.yml, poodle_fix.yml) are working correctly and don't need functional changes.
2. The InSpec tests are currently being used with Test Kitchen as specified in kitchen.yml.
3. The deployment scripts are used for setting up Chef infrastructure, which may not be needed if fully migrating to Ansible.
4. The repository is primarily for demonstration purposes rather than production use, based on the README description.
5. The hardcoded credentials in the deployment scripts are for demonstration purposes and would be replaced with secure alternatives in production.
6. The target environment is Ubuntu 20.04 as specified in kitchen.yml.
