# MIGRATION FROM CHEF/ANSIBLE TO ANSIBLE

## Executive Summary

This repository contains a mix of Chef InSpec tests and Ansible playbooks that are used together to demonstrate compliance automation. The primary focus appears to be showing how Chef InSpec can be used alongside Ansible for compliance testing. Additionally, there are Chef Automate and Chef Infra Server deployment scripts. The migration scope is relatively small, with only a few Ansible playbooks and InSpec tests to migrate. The estimated timeline for migration is 1-2 weeks, with low complexity.

## Module Migration Plan

This repository contains Chef InSpec tests and Ansible playbooks that need individual migration planning:

### MODULE INVENTORY

    - Description: Ansible playbook that sets up an Apache web server with HTTPS enabled using self-signed certificates
    - Path: chef-and-ansible/website_https.yml
    - Technology: Ansible
    - Key Features: Apache2 installation, SSL certificate generation, virtual host configuration

- **poodle_fix**:
    - Description: Ansible playbook that fixes SSL configuration in Apache to mitigate POODLE vulnerability
    - Path: chef-and-ansible/poodle_fix.yml
    - Technology: Ansible
    - Key Features: Disables vulnerable SSL protocols, enables TLSv1.2

- **website_https_verify**:
    - Description: Chef InSpec test that verifies HTTPS functionality and security
    - Path: chef-and-ansible/tests/website_https_verify.rb
    - Technology: Chef InSpec
    - Key Features: Port listening check, HTTPS response verification, SSL protocol verification

- **ssh_profile**:
    - Description: Chef InSpec test that verifies SSH security configuration
    - Path: chef-and-ansible/tests/ssh_profile.rb
    - Technology: Chef InSpec
    - Key Features: SSH root login check, compliance with security standards

- **chef-automate-deployment**:
    - Description: Bash script for deploying Chef Automate and Chef Infra Server
    - Path: setup-automate/deploy-automate.sh
    - Technology: Bash/Chef
    - Key Features: Chef Automate installation, Chef Infra Server installation, user and organization creation

- **chef-server-deployment**:
    - Description: Bash script for deploying Chef Infra Server without Automate
    - Path: setup-automate/deploy-chef-server.sh
    - Technology: Bash/Chef
    - Key Features: Chef Infra Server installation, user and organization creation

### Infrastructure Files

- `kitchen.yml`: Test Kitchen configuration for running Ansible playbooks and InSpec tests. Migration considerations include replacing with Ansible-native testing frameworks like Molecule.
- `index.html`: Simple HTML file used as a template for the website. Can be directly used in Ansible.

### Target Details

Analyze the source repository to determine target environment specifications:

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04 (explicitly specified in kitchen.yml)
- **Virtual Machine Technology**: Vagrant (specified in kitchen.yml driver)
- **Cloud Platform**: Not specified, appears to be on-premises or generic cloud VM

## Migration Approach

### Key Dependencies to Address

- **Chef InSpec**: Replace with Ansible-native testing solutions:
  - Option 1: Use Ansible's assert module for basic compliance checks
  - Option 2: Integrate with Ansible Lint for static analysis
  - Option 3: Use Molecule for comprehensive testing
  - Option 4: Consider migrating to ansible-test

- **Test Kitchen**: Replace with Molecule for Ansible role and playbook testing

### Security Considerations

- **SSL Configuration**: The migration must maintain the security hardening in the poodle_fix.yml playbook
  - Ensure TLSv1.2 is enforced and older protocols are disabled
  - Maintain proper certificate generation and management

- **SSH Security**: The SSH security controls tested by ssh_profile.rb need to be implemented in Ansible
  - Ensure root login remains disabled
  - Maintain compliance with security standards referenced (SRG-OS-000112, V-38607, etc.)

- **Vault/secrets management**:
  - Hardcoded credentials in setup scripts (username, password) should be moved to Ansible Vault
  - Self-signed certificates should be managed securely

### Technical Challenges

- **InSpec to Ansible Testing**: Converting InSpec tests to Ansible-native testing will require careful mapping of test assertions
  - Challenge: InSpec has specific matchers that may not have direct equivalents in Ansible
  - Mitigation: Create custom Ansible modules or use assert with appropriate conditions

- **Chef Automate/Server Deployment**: Replacing Chef infrastructure deployment scripts with Ansible
  - Challenge: The Chef Automate deployment has specific system requirements and configurations
  - Mitigation: Create Ansible roles that replicate the same system configurations and deployment steps

### Migration Order

1. **website_https.yml** (already in Ansible, low risk)
2. **poodle_fix.yml** (already in Ansible, low risk)
3. **InSpec Tests** (moderate complexity, requires conversion to Ansible testing framework)
4. **Chef Deployment Scripts** (high complexity, requires complete rewrite as Ansible playbooks)

### Assumptions

1. The primary goal is to migrate all components to pure Ansible without Chef dependencies
2. The InSpec tests are currently used for compliance verification and need equivalent functionality in Ansible
3. The deployment scripts are used for setting up Chef infrastructure which may no longer be needed if fully migrating to Ansible
4. The target environment will remain Ubuntu 20.04 or compatible
5. The security requirements and compliance standards referenced in the InSpec tests must be maintained
6. The repository is primarily for demonstration purposes rather than production use
7. No external data sources or complex integrations are present beyond what's visible in the repository
