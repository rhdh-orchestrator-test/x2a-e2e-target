# MIGRATION FROM CHEF/ANSIBLE TO ANSIBLE

## Executive Summary

This repository contains a mix of Chef InSpec tests and Ansible playbooks that are used together to demonstrate compliance automation. The primary focus appears to be showing how Chef InSpec can be used alongside Ansible for compliance testing. Additionally, there are bash scripts for deploying Chef Automate and Chef Infra Server. The migration scope is relatively small, with only a few Ansible playbooks and InSpec tests to migrate. The estimated timeline for migration is 1-2 weeks, with low complexity as most components are already in Ansible format.

## Module Migration Plan

This repository contains Chef InSpec tests and Ansible playbooks that need individual migration planning:

### MODULE INVENTORY

- **website_https**:
    - Description: Ansible playbook that sets up an Apache web server with HTTPS enabled using self-signed certificates
    - Path: chef-and-ansible/website_https.yml
    - Technology: Ansible
    - Key Features: Apache2 installation, SSL certificate generation, virtual host configuration

- **poodle_fix**:
    - Description: Ansible playbook that fixes SSL configuration in Apache to mitigate POODLE vulnerability
    - Path: chef-and-ansible/poodle_fix.yml
    - Technology: Ansible
    - Key Features: Disables SSLv3 and enables only TLSv1.2

- **website_https_verify**:
    - Description: Chef InSpec test that verifies HTTPS functionality and security
    - Path: chef-and-ansible/tests/website_https_verify.rb
    - Technology: Chef InSpec
    - Key Features: Port listening check, HTTPS response verification, SSL protocol verification

- **ssh_profile**:
    - Description: Chef InSpec test that verifies SSH root login is disabled (security compliance check)
    - Path: chef-and-ansible/tests/ssh_profile.rb
    - Technology: Chef InSpec
    - Key Features: SSH configuration verification, compliance with security standards

- **chef-automate-deployment**:
    - Description: Bash script for deploying Chef Automate and Chef Infra Server
    - Path: setup-automate/deploy-automate.sh
    - Technology: Bash
    - Key Features: Chef Automate installation, user and organization creation

- **chef-server-deployment**:
    - Description: Bash script for deploying Chef Infra Server without Automate
    - Path: setup-automate/deploy-chef-server.sh
    - Technology: Bash
    - Key Features: Chef Infra Server installation, user and organization creation

### Infrastructure Files

- `kitchen.yml`: Test Kitchen configuration for running Ansible playbooks and InSpec tests
- `index.html`: Simple HTML file used as a test page for the web server

### Target Details

Based on the source configuration files:

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04 (explicitly specified in kitchen.yml)
- **Virtual Machine Technology**: Vagrant (specified in kitchen.yml driver)
- **Cloud Platform**: Not specified, appears to be on-premises or generic cloud VM

## Migration Approach

### Key Dependencies to Address

- **Chef InSpec**: Replace with Ansible-native testing solutions:
  - Option 1: Use Ansible's assert module for basic compliance checks
  - Option 2: Integrate with Molecule for more comprehensive testing
  - Option 3: Use ansible-lint for static analysis of playbooks

- **Test Kitchen**: Replace with Molecule for Ansible playbook testing
  - Molecule provides similar functionality but is designed specifically for Ansible

- **Chef Automate/Infra Server**: Replace deployment scripts with Ansible playbooks
  - Create roles for system requirements configuration
  - Create playbooks for installation and configuration

### Security Considerations

- **SSL Configuration**: The migration must maintain the security hardening in the poodle_fix.yml playbook
  - Ensure TLSv1.2 is enforced and older protocols are disabled
  - Consider updating to include TLSv1.3 support

- **SSH Security**: Maintain the SSH root login restrictions verified by the InSpec test
  - Create equivalent Ansible assertions or molecule tests

- **Credentials Management**: 
  - The deployment scripts contain hardcoded credentials that should be moved to Ansible Vault
  - Count: 1 set of credentials in each deployment script (username, password)

### Technical Challenges

- **InSpec to Ansible Testing**: Converting InSpec tests to Ansible assertions or Molecule tests
  - Challenge: InSpec has specific testing constructs that may not have direct equivalents
  - Mitigation: Use a combination of Ansible assert module and custom scripts where needed

- **Maintaining Compliance Validation**: Ensuring the compliance checks remain effective
  - Challenge: Preserving the security validation intent of the InSpec tests
  - Mitigation: Document compliance requirements separately from implementation

### Migration Order

1. **website_https.yml** (already in Ansible format, low risk)
2. **poodle_fix.yml** (already in Ansible format, low risk)
3. **Chef InSpec tests** (convert to Ansible/Molecule tests, moderate complexity)
4. **Chef deployment scripts** (convert to Ansible playbooks, moderate complexity)

### Assumptions

1. The primary purpose of this repository is to demonstrate Chef InSpec with Ansible rather than production deployment
2. The target environment will continue to be Ubuntu 20.04 or compatible
3. Vagrant will continue to be used for development/testing environments
4. The security compliance requirements represented in the InSpec tests must be maintained
5. The deployment scripts are examples and not used in production (due to hardcoded credentials)
6. No external dependencies or integrations beyond what's visible in the repository
