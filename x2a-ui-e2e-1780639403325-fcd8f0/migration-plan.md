# MIGRATION FROM CHEF INSPEC AND ANSIBLE TO ANSIBLE

## Executive Summary

This repository contains a combination of Chef InSpec tests and Ansible playbooks that demonstrate how to use Chef InSpec for compliance testing alongside Ansible for configuration management. The migration scope is relatively small, focusing on converting Chef InSpec tests to Ansible-native testing solutions while preserving the existing Ansible playbooks. Additionally, there are Chef Automate and Chef Infra Server deployment scripts that need to be converted to Ansible playbooks.

**Estimated Timeline**: 1-2 weeks for a single developer, including testing and documentation.
**Complexity**: Low to Medium - The repository contains a limited number of files with straightforward functionality.

## Module Migration Plan

This repository contains Chef InSpec tests and Ansible playbooks that need individual migration planning:

### MODULE INVENTORY

- **website_https**:
    - Description: Ansible playbook that sets up an Apache web server with HTTPS enabled using self-signed certificates
    - Path: chef-and-ansible/website_https.yml
    - Technology: Ansible
    - Key Features: Apache2 installation, SSL certificate generation, virtual host configuration

- **poodle_fix**:
    - Description: Ansible playbook that remediates the POODLE vulnerability by disabling SSLv3 and enabling only TLSv1.2
    - Path: chef-and-ansible/poodle_fix.yml
    - Technology: Ansible
    - Key Features: Apache SSL configuration hardening

- **website_https_verify**:
    - Description: Chef InSpec test that verifies HTTPS functionality and security
    - Path: chef-and-ansible/tests/website_https_verify.rb
    - Technology: Chef InSpec
    - Key Features: Port listening check, HTTPS response validation, SSL protocol verification

- **ssh_profile**:
    - Description: Chef InSpec control that verifies SSH root login is disabled for security compliance
    - Path: chef-and-ansible/tests/ssh_profile.rb
    - Technology: Chef InSpec
    - Key Features: SSH configuration validation, security compliance check with STIG references

- **chef-automate-deployment**:
    - Description: Bash script to deploy Chef Automate and Chef Infra Server
    - Path: setup-automate/deploy-automate.sh
    - Technology: Bash with Chef CLI
    - Key Features: Chef Automate installation, user and organization creation

- **chef-server-deployment**:
    - Description: Bash script to deploy Chef Infra Server without Automate
    - Path: setup-automate/deploy-chef-server.sh
    - Technology: Bash with Chef CLI
    - Key Features: Chef Server installation, user and organization creation

### Infrastructure Files

- `kitchen.yml`: Test Kitchen configuration for running Ansible playbooks and InSpec tests. Will need to be replaced with Ansible-native testing framework configuration.
- `index.html`: Sample HTML file used for testing the web server deployment.

### Target Details

Based on the source configuration files:

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04 (explicitly specified in kitchen.yml)
- **Virtual Machine Technology**: Vagrant (specified in kitchen.yml driver)
- **Cloud Platform**: Not specified, but the deployment scripts are designed to work on both on-premises and cloud VMs

## Migration Approach

### Key Dependencies to Address

- **Chef InSpec**: Replace with Ansible-native testing solutions:
  - Option 1: Use Ansible's `assert` module for basic testing
  - Option 2: Integrate with Molecule for more comprehensive testing
  - Option 3: Use ansible-lint for static analysis of playbooks

- **Test Kitchen**: Replace with Molecule for Ansible playbook testing

- **Chef Automate/Infra Server**: Replace with Ansible AWX/Tower or other Ansible management platform

### Security Considerations

- **SSL Configuration**: The migration must preserve the security hardening in the poodle_fix.yml playbook
  - Ensure TLSv1.2 remains enabled and older protocols remain disabled
  - Maintain proper certificate generation and management

- **SSH Hardening**: The SSH security controls tested by ssh_profile.rb need to be implemented in Ansible
  - Create an Ansible task to ensure PermitRootLogin is not set to 'yes'
  - Implement equivalent STIG compliance checks

- **Vault/secrets management**:
  - Hardcoded credentials in deploy-automate.sh and deploy-chef-server.sh scripts need to be moved to Ansible Vault
  - Count: 2 credential sets (username/password) in deployment scripts

### Technical Challenges

- **InSpec to Ansible Testing**: Converting InSpec tests to Ansible assertions or Molecule tests
  - Mitigation: Use Ansible's uri module for HTTP/HTTPS testing and command/shell modules with appropriate assertions for SSL protocol verification

- **Chef Server Deployment**: Converting Chef server deployment scripts to Ansible
  - Mitigation: Create Ansible roles for Chef server deployment or replace with AWX/Tower deployment

### Migration Order

1. **Ansible Playbooks** (website_https.yml, poodle_fix.yml): Low risk as they can remain largely unchanged
2. **InSpec Tests** (website_https_verify.rb, ssh_profile.rb): Convert to Ansible-native testing
3. **Deployment Scripts** (deploy-automate.sh, deploy-chef-server.sh): Convert to Ansible playbooks or replace functionality

### Assumptions

1. The existing Ansible playbooks (website_https.yml, poodle_fix.yml) are functioning correctly and don't require significant changes
2. The Chef InSpec tests are currently used for validation only and not for active remediation
3. The deployment scripts are used for setting up test environments and not production systems
4. No external dependencies or integrations beyond what's visible in the repository
5. No custom Chef resources or complex InSpec profiles that would require special handling
6. The target environment will continue to be Ubuntu 20.04 or compatible systems
7. The migration is primarily focused on replacing Chef InSpec with Ansible-native testing while maintaining the same level of security validation
8. No CI/CD pipeline integration is currently in place that would need to be updated
