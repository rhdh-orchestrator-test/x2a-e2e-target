# MIGRATION FROM CHEF/ANSIBLE TO ANSIBLE

## Executive Summary

This repository contains a mix of Chef InSpec tests and Ansible playbooks that are used together to demonstrate compliance automation. The primary focus appears to be showing how Chef InSpec can be used alongside Ansible for compliance testing. Additionally, there are bash scripts for deploying Chef Automate and Chef Infra Server.

The migration scope is relatively small, with only a few Ansible playbooks and InSpec tests to migrate. The estimated timeline for migration is 1-2 weeks, with low complexity as most components are already in Ansible format.

## Module Migration Plan

This repository contains Chef InSpec tests and Ansible playbooks that need individual migration planning:

### MODULE INVENTORY

- **website_https**:
    - Description: Ansible playbook that sets up an Apache web server with HTTPS enabled using self-signed certificates
    - Path: chef-and-ansible/website_https.yml
    - Technology: Ansible
    - Key Features: Apache2 installation, SSL certificate generation, virtual host configuration

- **poodle_fix**:
    - Description: Ansible playbook that fixes SSL configuration in Apache to mitigate POODLE vulnerability
    - Path: chef-and-ansible/poodle_fix.yml
    - Technology: Ansible
    - Key Features: Disables SSLv3 and enables only TLSv1.2

- **website_https_verify**:
    - Description: Chef InSpec test that verifies HTTPS functionality and security
    - Path: chef-and-ansible/tests/website_https_verify.rb
    - Technology: Chef InSpec
    - Key Features: Port listening check, HTTPS response validation, SSL protocol verification

- **ssh_profile**:
    - Description: Chef InSpec test that verifies SSH security configuration
    - Path: chef-and-ansible/tests/ssh_profile.rb
    - Technology: Chef InSpec
    - Key Features: SSH root login check, compliance with security standards (SRG-OS-000112)

- **chef-server-deployment**:
    - Description: Bash script for deploying Chef Infra Server
    - Path: setup-automate/deploy-chef-server.sh
    - Technology: Bash
    - Key Features: Chef server installation, user and organization creation

- **automate-deployment**:
    - Description: Bash script for deploying Chef Automate and Chef Infra Server
    - Path: setup-automate/deploy-automate.sh
    - Technology: Bash
    - Key Features: Chef Automate installation, Chef server installation, user and organization creation

### Infrastructure Files

- `kitchen.yml`: Test Kitchen configuration for running Ansible playbooks and InSpec tests. Migration consideration: Replace with Ansible-native testing framework like Molecule.
- `index.html`: Simple HTML file used for testing. Migration consideration: Keep as-is or include as a template in Ansible.

### Target Details

Analyze the source repository to determine target environment specifications:

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04 (explicitly specified in kitchen.yml)
- **Virtual Machine Technology**: Vagrant (specified in kitchen.yml driver)
- **Cloud Platform**: Not specified, appears to be on-premises or generic cloud VM setup

## Migration Approach

### Key Dependencies to Address

- **Chef InSpec**: Replace with Ansible-native testing solutions:
  - Option 1: Use Ansible's assert module for basic compliance checks
  - Option 2: Use Molecule for testing Ansible roles
  - Option 3: Integrate with other compliance tools like Ansible Lint or OpenSCAP

- **Test Kitchen**: Replace with Molecule for testing Ansible roles and playbooks

### Security Considerations

- **SSL Configuration**: The playbooks configure Apache with SSL. Ensure proper SSL configuration is maintained in the migrated Ansible playbooks.
  - Migration approach: Use Ansible's openssl_* modules as already implemented

- **SSH Security**: The InSpec tests verify SSH security configurations.
  - Migration approach: Create equivalent Ansible tasks to verify and enforce SSH security settings

- **Vault/secrets management**:
  - Hardcoded credentials in setup scripts (username, password)
  - Migration approach: Replace with Ansible Vault for secure credential storage

### Technical Challenges

- **InSpec to Ansible Testing**: Converting InSpec tests to Ansible assertions or other testing frameworks.
  - Mitigation strategy: Use Ansible's assert module for basic tests, consider integrating with other compliance tools for more complex tests.

- **Chef Server Deployment**: Converting Chef server deployment scripts to Ansible.
  - Mitigation strategy: Create Ansible roles for Chef server deployment if still needed, or consider eliminating if moving entirely to Ansible.

### Migration Order

1. **website_https.yml** and **poodle_fix.yml** (low risk, already in Ansible format)
2. **InSpec tests** (moderate complexity, requires conversion to Ansible testing framework)
3. **Chef deployment scripts** (high complexity, requires complete rewrite or elimination)

### Assumptions

1. The primary goal is to migrate all components to pure Ansible without dependencies on Chef tools.
2. The InSpec tests need to be converted to equivalent functionality in Ansible or another testing framework.
3. The Chef server deployment scripts may be eliminated if the infrastructure is moving entirely to Ansible.
4. The target environment will continue to be Ubuntu 20.04 or compatible systems.
5. The self-signed certificates approach is acceptable for the migrated solution.
6. The hardcoded credentials in the deployment scripts will be replaced with a more secure approach.
7. The migration will maintain the same level of security compliance as the original implementation.
