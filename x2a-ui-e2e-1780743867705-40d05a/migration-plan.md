# MIGRATION FROM CHEF INSPEC AND ANSIBLE TO ANSIBLE

## Executive Summary

This repository contains a combination of Chef InSpec tests and Ansible playbooks designed to demonstrate compliance automation with Ansible. The migration scope is relatively small, focusing on converting Chef InSpec tests to Ansible-native solutions while preserving the existing Ansible playbooks. The repository also includes Chef Automate and Chef Infra Server deployment scripts that need to be converted to Ansible playbooks.

Estimated timeline: 1-2 weeks for a single developer, considering the limited scope and complexity.

## Module Migration Plan

This repository contains Chef InSpec tests and Ansible playbooks that need individual migration planning:

### MODULE INVENTORY

- **poodle_fix**:
    - Description: Ansible playbook that fixes SSL configuration in Apache to mitigate POODLE vulnerability
    - Path: chef-and-ansible/poodle_fix.yml
    - Technology: Ansible
    - Key Features: Disables vulnerable SSL protocols, enables TLSv1.2

    - Description: Chef InSpec test that verifies HTTPS functionality and security
    - Path: chef-and-ansible/tests/website_https_verify.rb
    - Technology: Chef InSpec
    - Key Features: Port listening check, HTTPS response validation, SSL protocol verification

- **ssh_profile**:
    - Description: Chef InSpec control that verifies SSH root login is disabled for security compliance
    - Path: chef-and-ansible/tests/ssh_profile.rb
    - Technology: Chef InSpec
    - Key Features: SSH configuration validation, compliance with security standards (STIG)

- **chef-automate-deployment**:
    - Description: Bash script for deploying Chef Automate and Chef Infra Server
    - Path: setup-automate/deploy-automate.sh
    - Technology: Bash/Chef
    - Key Features: Chef Automate installation, user and organization creation

- **chef-server-deployment**:
    - Description: Bash script for deploying Chef Infra Server without Automate
    - Path: setup-automate/deploy-chef-server.sh
    - Technology: Bash/Chef
    - Key Features: Chef Infra Server installation, user and organization creation

### Infrastructure Files

- `kitchen.yml`: Test Kitchen configuration for running Ansible playbooks and InSpec tests. Will need to be replaced with Ansible-native testing framework like Molecule.
- `index.html`: Sample HTML file used for testing the web server. Can be preserved as-is or incorporated into Ansible templates.

### Target Details

Based on the source configuration files:

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04 (explicitly specified in kitchen.yml)
- **Virtual Machine Technology**: Vagrant (specified in kitchen.yml driver)
- **Cloud Platform**: Not specified, but scripts are designed to work on both on-premises and cloud VMs

## Migration Approach

### Key Dependencies to Address

- **Chef InSpec**: Replace with Ansible-native testing solutions:
  - Option 1: Use Ansible's `assert` module for basic compliance checks
  - Option 2: Integrate with Ansible Lint for static analysis
  - Option 3: Use Molecule for comprehensive testing
  - Option 4: Consider OpenSCAP integration for compliance automation

- **Test Kitchen**: Replace with Molecule for Ansible role testing

### Security Considerations

- **SSL Configuration**: The migration must preserve the security hardening in the poodle_fix.yml playbook
  - Ensure TLSv1.2 is enforced and older protocols are disabled
  - Maintain proper certificate generation and management

- **SSH Security**: The SSH root login check must be preserved in the Ansible equivalent
  - Convert the InSpec control to Ansible assertions or include in an Ansible role

- **Vault/secrets management**:
  - Hardcoded credentials in setup scripts (username, password) should be moved to Ansible Vault
  - Count: 2 credential sets (username/password) in deploy-automate.sh and deploy-chef-server.sh

### Technical Challenges

- **InSpec to Ansible Testing**: Converting InSpec tests to Ansible-native testing requires careful mapping of test assertions
  - Mitigation: Create a mapping document for InSpec resources to Ansible modules
  - Consider using Ansible's assert module with appropriate conditionals

- **Compliance Reporting**: InSpec provides rich compliance reporting that needs an equivalent in Ansible
  - Mitigation: Explore integration with AWX/Tower for compliance reporting or consider additional tools like OpenSCAP

- **Chef Server Deployment**: Converting Chef server deployment scripts to Ansible requires understanding of Chef server architecture
  - Mitigation: Create Ansible roles that replicate the Chef server deployment process, possibly using the official Chef packages

### Migration Order

1. **Ansible Playbooks** (website_https.yml, poodle_fix.yml): Low risk as they are already in Ansible format, may need minor updates for best practices
2. **InSpec Tests** (website_https_verify.rb, ssh_profile.rb): Convert to Ansible-native testing solutions
3. **Chef Deployment Scripts** (deploy-automate.sh, deploy-chef-server.sh): Convert to Ansible playbooks with proper variable management

### Assumptions

1. The target environment will continue to be Ubuntu 20.04 or compatible Linux distributions
2. The migration aims to replace Chef InSpec with Ansible-native solutions while maintaining the same level of compliance checking
3. The existing Ansible playbooks are functional and follow best practices
4. There is no requirement to maintain backward compatibility with Chef InSpec
5. The deployment scripts are used for setting up test environments and not production systems
6. The hardcoded credentials in the deployment scripts are for demonstration purposes only
7. The SSL certificates generated are self-signed and for testing purposes only
8. The compliance requirements (like STIG) mentioned in the InSpec tests need to be preserved in the Ansible solution
