# MIGRATION FROM CHEF INSPEC AND ANSIBLE TO ANSIBLE

## Executive Summary

This repository contains a combination of Chef InSpec tests and Ansible playbooks designed to demonstrate compliance automation with Ansible. The migration scope is relatively small, focusing on converting Chef InSpec tests to Ansible-native solutions while preserving the existing Ansible playbooks. Additionally, there are Chef Automate and Chef Infra Server deployment scripts that need to be converted to Ansible playbooks.

**Estimated Timeline**: 1-2 weeks for a single engineer, including testing and documentation.
**Complexity**: Low to Medium - The repository contains a limited number of files with straightforward functionality.

## Module Migration Plan

This repository contains Chef InSpec tests and Ansible playbooks that need individual migration planning:

### MODULE INVENTORY

    - Description: Chef InSpec test that verifies HTTPS functionality and security
    - Path: chef-and-ansible/tests/website_https_verify.rb
    - Technology: Chef InSpec
    - Key Features: Port listening check, HTTPS response validation, SSL protocol verification

- **ssh_profile**:
    - Description: Chef InSpec control that verifies SSH root login is disabled for security compliance
    - Path: chef-and-ansible/tests/ssh_profile.rb
    - Technology: Chef InSpec
    - Key Features: SSH configuration validation, compliance with security standards (STIG)

- **chef-automate-deployment**:
    - Description: Bash script for deploying Chef Automate and Chef Infra Server
    - Path: setup-automate/deploy-automate.sh
    - Technology: Bash/Chef
    - Key Features: Chef Automate installation, Chef Server configuration, user and organization setup

- **chef-server-deployment**:
    - Description: Bash script for deploying Chef Infra Server without Automate
    - Path: setup-automate/deploy-chef-server.sh
    - Technology: Bash/Chef
    - Key Features: Chef Server installation, user and organization setup

### Infrastructure Files

- `kitchen.yml`: Test Kitchen configuration for running Ansible playbooks and InSpec tests. Will need to be replaced with Ansible-native testing framework like Molecule.
- `index.html`: Simple HTML file used for testing the web server. Can be preserved as-is or incorporated into Ansible content.

### Target Details

Based on the source configuration files:

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04 (explicitly specified in kitchen.yml)
- **Virtual Machine Technology**: Vagrant (specified in kitchen.yml driver)
- **Cloud Platform**: Not specified, but the deployment scripts suggest they could be used in cloud environments

## Migration Approach

### Key Dependencies to Address

- **Chef InSpec**: Replace with Ansible-native testing solutions:
  - Option 1: Use Ansible's assert module for basic compliance checks
  - Option 2: Integrate with Ansible Lint for static analysis
  - Option 3: Use Molecule for comprehensive testing
  - Option 4: Consider Red Hat Insights or Ansible Automation Platform for enterprise compliance

- **Test Kitchen**: Replace with Molecule for Ansible role testing

- **Chef Automate/Infra Server**: Replace with Ansible Automation Platform or open-source Ansible AWX

### Security Considerations

- **SSL/TLS Configuration**: The migration must preserve the security hardening in the poodle_fix.yml playbook
  - Approach: Convert the InSpec tests to Ansible assert tasks that verify the same security controls

- **SSH Security Controls**: The SSH root login check needs to be implemented in Ansible
  - Approach: Create an Ansible task that checks the sshd_config file for the PermitRootLogin setting

- **Vault/secrets management**:
  - Hardcoded credentials in setup scripts (username, password) should be moved to Ansible Vault
  - Count: 2 credential sets detected in deployment scripts

### Technical Challenges

- **InSpec to Ansible Testing**: Converting InSpec's testing capabilities to Ansible's more limited testing framework
  - Mitigation: Use a combination of Ansible assert module and custom scripts where necessary

- **Compliance Reporting**: InSpec provides rich compliance reporting that Ansible doesn't natively support
  - Mitigation: Consider integrating with additional tools like OpenSCAP or Ansible Automation Platform's compliance features

### Migration Order

1. **Ansible Playbooks** (website_https.yml, poodle_fix.yml): Low risk as they're already in Ansible format, may need minor updates for best practices
2. **InSpec Tests** (website_https_verify.rb, ssh_profile.rb): Convert to Ansible assert tasks or Molecule tests
3. **Deployment Scripts** (deploy-automate.sh, deploy-chef-server.sh): Convert to Ansible roles for infrastructure deployment

### Assumptions

1. The target environment will continue to be Ubuntu 20.04 or compatible systems
2. The migration is focused on replacing Chef InSpec with Ansible-native solutions, not necessarily changing the functionality
3. There are no external dependencies or integrations not visible in the provided files
4. The deployment scripts are standalone and not part of a larger Chef ecosystem
5. No specific performance requirements are needed for the Ansible implementation
6. The self-signed certificates approach is acceptable for the migrated solution
7. The hardcoded credentials in the deployment scripts are for demonstration purposes and will be properly secured in the migrated solution
