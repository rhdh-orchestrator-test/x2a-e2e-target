# MIGRATION FROM CHEF/ANSIBLE TO ANSIBLE

## Executive Summary

This repository contains a mix of Chef InSpec tests and Ansible playbooks that are used together to demonstrate compliance automation. The primary focus appears to be showing how Chef InSpec can be used alongside Ansible for compliance testing. Additionally, there are bash scripts for deploying Chef Automate and Chef Infra Server.

The migration scope is relatively small, with only a few Ansible playbooks and InSpec tests to migrate. The estimated timeline for migration would be 1-2 weeks, with low complexity as most components are already in Ansible format.

## Module Migration Plan

This repository contains Chef InSpec tests and Ansible playbooks that need individual migration planning:

### MODULE INVENTORY

- **website_https**:
    - Description: Ansible playbook that sets up an Apache web server with HTTPS support using self-signed certificates
    - Path: chef-and-ansible/website_https.yml
    - Technology: Ansible
    - Key Features: Apache configuration, SSL certificate generation, virtual host setup

- **poodle_fix**:
    - Description: Ansible playbook that fixes SSL configuration in Apache to mitigate POODLE vulnerability
    - Path: chef-and-ansible/poodle_fix.yml
    - Technology: Ansible
    - Key Features: Disables vulnerable SSL protocols, enables TLSv1.2

- **website_https_verify**:
    - Description: Chef InSpec test that verifies HTTPS functionality and security
    - Path: chef-and-ansible/tests/website_https_verify.rb
    - Technology: Chef InSpec
    - Key Features: Port listening check, HTTPS response validation, SSL protocol verification

- **ssh_profile**:
    - Description: Chef InSpec test that verifies SSH security configuration (root login disabled)
    - Path: chef-and-ansible/tests/ssh_profile.rb
    - Technology: Chef InSpec
    - Key Features: SSH configuration validation, compliance with security standards (STIG)

- **chef-automate-deployment**:
    - Description: Bash script for deploying Chef Automate and Chef Infra Server
    - Path: setup-automate/deploy-automate.sh
    - Technology: Bash
    - Key Features: Chef Automate installation, user and organization creation

- **chef-server-deployment**:
    - Description: Bash script for deploying Chef Infra Server without Automate
    - Path: setup-automate/deploy-chef-server.sh
    - Technology: Bash
    - Key Features: Chef Server installation, user and organization creation

### Infrastructure Files

- `kitchen.yml`: Test Kitchen configuration for running Ansible playbooks and InSpec tests
- `index.html`: Simple HTML file used as a test page for the web server

### Target Details

Based on the source configuration files:

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04 (explicitly specified in kitchen.yml)
- **Virtual Machine Technology**: Vagrant (specified in kitchen.yml driver)
- **Cloud Platform**: Not specified, appears to be on-premises or generic cloud VM

## Migration Approach

### Key Dependencies to Address

- **Chef InSpec**: Replace with Ansible alternatives:
  - Option 1: Use Ansible's built-in assert module for simple tests
  - Option 2: Use Ansible Lint for static analysis
  - Option 3: Use Molecule for testing Ansible roles
  - Option 4: Keep InSpec as a testing tool but integrate with Ansible workflows

- **Test Kitchen**: Replace with:
  - Molecule for Ansible role testing
  - Or adapt existing kitchen.yml to work with pure Ansible

### Security Considerations

- **SSL Configuration**: The migration must maintain the security hardening in the poodle_fix.yml playbook
  - Ensure TLSv1.2 is enforced and older protocols are disabled
  - Maintain proper certificate generation and configuration

- **SSH Security**: The SSH security checks in ssh_profile.rb need to be preserved
  - Ensure root login remains disabled
  - Consider implementing these checks as Ansible assertions or molecule tests

- **Vault/secrets management**:
  - Hardcoded credentials in deploy-automate.sh and deploy-chef-server.sh scripts need to be moved to Ansible Vault
  - Count: 2 credential sets (username/password) in deployment scripts

### Technical Challenges

- **InSpec to Ansible Testing**: Converting InSpec tests to Ansible-native testing methods
  - Mitigation: Use Ansible assert module for basic tests, consider keeping InSpec for complex compliance testing

- **Chef Automate Deployment**: Converting the Chef Automate deployment scripts to Ansible
  - Mitigation: Create Ansible roles for Chef Automate and Chef Server deployment, using the official installation methods

### Migration Order

1. **website_https.yml** (already in Ansible format, low risk)
2. **poodle_fix.yml** (already in Ansible format, low risk)
3. **InSpec Tests** (moderate complexity, requires conversion to Ansible testing framework)
4. **Chef Deployment Scripts** (higher complexity, requires creating Ansible roles for Chef deployment)

### Assumptions

1. The primary goal is to standardize on Ansible as the configuration management tool
2. The InSpec tests are still needed for compliance validation
3. Chef Automate and Chef Server deployment are still required (not being replaced by other tools)
4. The target environment will remain Ubuntu 20.04 on Vagrant VMs
5. No external dependencies or integrations beyond what's visible in the repository
6. No complex data structures or external data sources are being used
7. The migration doesn't need to address scaling concerns (appears to be for demonstration purposes)
8. The security requirements in the InSpec tests must be maintained in the Ansible implementation
